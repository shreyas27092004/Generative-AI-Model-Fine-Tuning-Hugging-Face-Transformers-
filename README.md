# Fine-Tuning Generative AI with Hugging Face 

This project demonstrates **fine-tuning a generative AI model** using Hugging Face Transformers.  
The notebook walks through **data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and inference** for a text generation task.

##  Features
- Data preprocessing and tokenization  
- Loading and fine-tuning pretrained Hugging Face models  
- Evaluation metrics (loss, perplexity, etc.)  
- Generating text with the fine-tuned model  
- Easy to adapt for different datasets  

##  Requirements
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook / Jupyter Lab
- Transformers
- Datasets
- Torch
- Pandas
- NumPy

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

##  Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/genai-finetuning.git
   cd genai-finetuning
   ```

2. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Lab_2_fine_tune_generative_ai_model.ipynb
   ```

3. Run through each cell to:

   * Preprocess your dataset
   * Fine-tune the model
   * Evaluate results
   * Generate new text

##  Example Usage

After training, you can generate text using prompts like:

```python
prompt = "Once upon a time,"
generated_text = model.generate(prompt)
print(generated_text)
```

##  Use Cases

* Story and creative writing generation
* Chatbot and conversational agents
* Domain-specific text generation (e.g., healthcare, legal, finance)

##  Contributing
Contributions are welcome!

* Fork the repo
* Create a feature branch
* Submit a pull request
